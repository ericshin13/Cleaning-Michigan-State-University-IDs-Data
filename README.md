# Data Cleaning Project
This section of the ongoing SMALS research project aimed to clean up the Michigan State University IDs data set (msuids). The main task was to extract key variables from the original filenames column and place them into separate columns in a new data set. These variables included Year, ExamType, Course, Instructor, QuestionNumber, Semester, StudentID, QuestionConcept, QuestionContext, and QuestionType. Another task involved visualizing the frequency of each extracted variable using bar graphs. The overarching goal of the SMALS project is to analyze student-constructed models of biological systems and statistical concepts through a network science approach to explore changes in models as evidence of learning. For my part, I wanted to gain research experience and improve my coding skills in RStudio by learning techniques to extract data using regular expressions, create new columns, and eventually generate network plots. This section of the project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning using regular expressions, data visualization with ggplot, data interpretation, and technical reporting.

# Cleaning Michigan State University IDs Data Set
This project focused on cleaning the Michigan State University IDs data set (msuids). The main task was to extract key variables from the filenames column and place them into separate columns. These included Year, ExamType, Course, Instructor, QuestionNumber, Semester, StudentID, QuestionConcept, QuestionContext, and QuestionType. Another task was visualizing the frequency of each variable using bar graphs. I aimed to gain research experience and enhance my coding skills in RStudio by learning data extraction with regular expressions, creating new columns, and generating network plots. This work showcases my abilities in data cleaning, visualization with ggplot, interpretation, and technical reporting of findings.
